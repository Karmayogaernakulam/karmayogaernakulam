<p>We believe that empowering communities to take up developmental projects brings accountability through the active participation of the entire community. Projects are most successful when the community takes ownership at every stage, right from planning and funding to implementation and sustainability of their initiatives.</p>
<p>The Art of Living’s role is to become a driver of change by helping communities to shift their mindset from a ‘want state’ to becoming the ‘drivers of change’ themselves. We do this through our capacity building workshops, awareness campaigns, resource-building exercises and by offering technical expertise to help communities become independent and empowered.</p>
<p>The Art of Living has made Youth Leadership Training Program (YLTP) its vehicle for this transformation, resulting in efficient and effective delivery of its projects. Motivated youth are selected from the local communities and trained appropriately.</p>
<p>The YLTP focusses on personal development and communication skills. Through stress-reducing breathing techniques, individuals find inner peace and communities to come together in a spirit of service. Participants are inspired to volunteer for rural projects. The fruits of the seeds sown in these sessions are experienced by the community as a whole.</p>
